# Photo Sharing App — Architecture Plan

## Overview
A full-stack photo sharing application where users can upload, view, and interact with photos. Built with React (frontend) on port **5173** and FastAPI (backend) on port **8080**.

---

## Port Contract
| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| **Frontend (React/Vite)** | `5173` |
| **Backend (FastAPI)** | `8080` |

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Photo Upload** — Users can upload photos with a title and description
2. **Photo Feed** — Browse all uploaded photos in a responsive grid gallery
3. **Photo Detail View** — Click a photo to see full size with metadata
4. **Delete Photo** — Remove a photo from the gallery
5. **Static File Serving** — FastAPI serves uploaded images as static files

## Backend Architecture (FastAPI — Port 8080)

### API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/photos` | Fetch all photos |
| `POST` | `/api/photos/upload` | Upload a new photo |
| `GET` | `/api/photos/{photo_id}` | Get single photo metadata |
| `DELETE` | `/api/photos/{photo_id}` | Delete a photo |
| `GET` | `/uploads/{filename}` | Serve static image files |

### Data Model
```python
Photo {
  id: str (UUID)
  title: str
  description: str
  filename: str
  url: str
  uploaded_at: datetime
}
```

### File Structure
```
backend/
├── main.py                  # FastAPI app entry point, CORS, static files, port 8080
├── models.py                # Pydantic models for Photo
├── database.py              # In-memory or JSON-based storage (photos_db)
├── routers/
│   └── photos.py            # All photo-related route handlers
├── utils/
│   └── file_handler.py      # File saving, validation, deletion logic
├── uploads/                 # Directory where uploaded images are stored
└── requirements.txt         # fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart, pillow
```

### Key Backend Details
- **CORS** configured to allow `http://localhost:5173`
- **Static files** mounted at `/uploads` pointing to `./uploads` directory
- **File validation**: Accept only `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`
- **Storage**: JSON flat-file (`photos_db.json`) for persistence across restarts
- **Uvicorn** runs on `host=0.0.0.0`, `port=8080`

### Key Frontend Details
- **React Router v6** for navigation between feed and detail views
- **Axios** base URL set to `http://localhost:8080`
- **Upload flow**: `FormData` POST with file + title + description fields
- **Image display**: `<img src="http://localhost:8080/uploads/{filename}" />`
- **State management**: Local component state + custom `usePhotos` hook
- **Responsive grid**: CSS Grid with `auto-fill` columns for all screen sizes

## Data Flow

```
User selects file → UploadModal (FormData)
        ↓

        ↓
file_handler saves to /uploads/
        ↓
Photo record saved to photos_db.json
        ↓
Response returns Photo object with URL
        ↓
React re-fetches GET /api/photos
        ↓
PhotoGrid renders updated gallery
